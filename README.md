## Usage 

*When you enter the site, if you click on any of the breadcrumbs in the navbar, it will scroll you to the designated section on the page. The 'Hot or Iced?' section pulls the temperature from your current location and displays whether it is a good day for hot or iced coffee. Our '~Random Coffee~' section has a button that, when clicked, will generate a recipe for our array of coffee drinks.
